**FracPy** is a **Python port** of [FracPaQ](https://github.com/DaveHealy-github/FracPaQ), a MATLABâ„¢ toolbox for the quantification of fracture patterns.  

The main goal of this project is to provide a Python implementation of FracPaQ, making the application more accessible and easier to integrate with modern scientific workflows based on Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.
